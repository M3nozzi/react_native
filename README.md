  Challenge: Node.js Concepts
</h3>

## :rocket: About the challenge
The challenge is to build a mobile version to the application that store the portfolio repositories, which you already developed the backend using Node.js and the web version using React JS.

### Technologies
React Native
Test: Jest JS

### Application features

- **`List the repositories from API`** Should be able to create a list of all the repositories that are registered in the API with the title, techs and number of likes fields following the $ {repository.likes} likes pattern, just changing the number to be dynamic.

- **`Like the repositories from API`** Must be able to like an item in the API through a button with the text Like and it must update the number of likes in the listing on the mobile.

### Testing specification
In each test, you have a brief description of what your application must do in order for the test to pass.

- **`should add a like to the like counter of the repository`**:  In order for this test to pass, your application must allow, by clicking on the `Like` button, a like to be added to the listed repository, and that this update can be viewed on the screen.
